# SwipeChef

## About

SwipeChef is an android and iOS app designed to improve the way people search for and share recipes. Searching for recipes with SwipeChef requires no previous inspiration, can be done in as little as one minute, and simplifies decision-making by presenting one recipe at a time.

SwipeChef was made using React Native and Ruby on Rails.

## Features

- **Swiping:** Users can swipe through different recipes based on their culinary preferences. If they like a recipe, they can swipe right which will put that recipe in their fridge.
- **Fridge:** Recipes in a user's fridge expire after 10 days. If the user loves a recipe, they can publish it to their cookbook.
- **Cookbook:** This is the user's profile page. They can add a photo and a tagline and view recipes they have saved. They can also add friends and look at their favourite recipes.
- **Details:** A user can tap on a recipe to get more information about that recipe. This includes details such as nutrition, ingredients, and the original recipe.
- **Settings:** If a user has dietary preferences or allergies, SwipeChef will filter recipes based on those selections.
